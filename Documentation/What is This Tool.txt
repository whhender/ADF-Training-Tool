What is DFTrainingEnvManager?

This is a PowerShell Script that creates a Data Factory Training environment within an azure subscription.
It then deploys several scenarios that can be used to practice troubleshooting.

Once you are finished with the environment, you can use this tool to remove the environment from your subscription.

The scenarios can be used for:
1. Kusto Training
2. Troubleshooting Training
3. Case Management Training

The tool is meant to be deployed by Data Factory SMEs/Mentors to train new engineers.

New scenarios can be added to the troubleshooting tool as well. If you do add scenarios, please feel free
to upload the changes/additions to git so all can enjoy.
