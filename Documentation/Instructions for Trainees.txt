1. Please send emails and meeting requests as you would to a real customer.
2. If you need a collab opened to another team, create a normal collab task but assign it to your
   trainer/mentor/the engineer delivering these scenarios. They will act as the engineer from another team.
3. If you want to open an ICM, create a collab task and provide all the information you would normally
   provide the product team, but assign the collab task to your trainer/mentor/the engineer delivering
   these scenarios. They will act as the product team for these cases.
4. Though the ASC search function is a great tool for troubleshooting customer cases, please do not use it 
   for these test cases. These test cases have been delivered to multiple engineers and will show up in ASC
   so please use other tools/troubleshooting processes to resolve.
5. If you need help troubleshooting, your mentor/trainer/the engineer delivering these scenarios can provide
   help as if they are a TA/peer who is helping you with a case. Do reach out to them!
6. Once you are finished with a case, please assign to your trainer/mentor/the engineer delivering training so
   they can appropriately close it as a test case.
